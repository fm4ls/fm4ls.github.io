    Foundation models and large language models (LLMs) represent a transformative advancement in life sciences,
    offering a new paradigm for understanding complex biological systems. These large-scale
    models are pretrained on extensive datasets encompassing various biological data types, enabling them to perform
    a wide range of tasks such as predicting protein structures, analyzing genomic sequences, and simulating cellular
    processes. Despite these advances, most existing foundation models and LLMs in life sciences focus on a single
    modality, such as protein sequences, genomic sequences, or single-cell transcriptomics.
    However, biological systems are inherently multi-modal, with complex interactions spanning different molecular
    and structural levels. For example, understanding protein function requires integrating sequence information
    with structural properties and interaction networks. Similarly, deciphering metabolic pathways involves linking
    small molecule representations with reaction kinetics and pathway annotations. Single-modal models often fail
    to capture these intricate relationships, limiting their applicability in real-world biological research.
  </p>
  <p>
    To address these limitations, there is a growing need for multi-modal foundation models and LLMs that can
effectively integrate and reason over diverse biological modalities. These models need to align heterogeneous
data types, handle missing or noisy modalities, and support biologically meaningful interpretations. Developing
such models poses unique challenges, including modality fusion strategies, cross-modal pretraining objectives,
and computational scalability. Additionally, ensuring interpretability and robustness remains essential for their
adoption in life sciences.

      This workshop will bring together researchers working at the intersection of multi-modal learning, founda-
tion models, LLMs, and life sciences to discuss recent advancements, explore methodological innovations, and
identify key challenges in designing multi-modal foundation models and LLMs for biological data. By foster-
ing interdisciplinary collaboration, the workshop aims to accelerate progress toward more comprehensive and
biologically grounded AI models for life sciences.</p>
    <p>
      We invite submissions of both theoretical works and empirical works, and the intersection of the two. 
      The topics include but are not limited to: 
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Theoretical foundations of SSL
    </li>
    <li>
      Multi-modal foundation models for learning representations of proteins, DNAs, RNAs, transcriptomic
data, metabolomic data, and other biological modalities.
    </li>
    <li>
      Multi-modal LLMs for predicting the functions of proteins, DNAs, RNAs, and other biomolecules.
    </li>
    <li>
      Multi-modal foundation models for learning joint representations of multi-omics data.
    </li>
    <li>
      Multi-modal generative models for designing proteins, DNAs, RNAs, and other biomolecules.
    </li>
    <li>
      Applications of multi-modal foundation models and LLMs in drug discovery, precision medicine, personalized treatment, and beyond.
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    </ul>
<!-- </div> -->
    <p>This year, this workshop will have a few invited talks by leading researchers from diverse backgrounds including multi-modal foundation models, LLMs, etc. 
      The workshop will also have contributed talks, poster sessions, and panel discussion session to share perspectives on 
      establishing foundational understanding of Multi-modal Foundation Models and Large
      Language Models for Life Sciences. 
      We accept short (max 4 pages) submissions. Each will be peer-reviewed by at least three reviewers. 
      The accepted papers are allowed to be submitted to other conference venues. 
      Please see our <a href="./pages/call-for-participation.html">call for papers </a> for details.
